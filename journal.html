                    <p style="color: white;">Ryan did a great job of teach our group about JavaScript. He hinted on JavaScript objects 
                        which I currently don't know much about. I learned about the for each loop. By looking at the syntax I didn't get it 
                        until it was pointed out to me that it's a call back function that loops itself. I was aware that JavaScript included 
                        triple equals operator, but I had no idea what the differnce was. Now, I am aware that a data conversion happens when 
                        using the double equals. A triple equals operator would come in handy. "On the Fly Functions" were also new to me. The 
                        concept is still kind of weird. I'm not sure why you would create a function to destroy it. I'm sure I'll look back at 
                        this and laugh. Our team works well together and offers insight. We have decided to use slack and zoom for communication. 
                        I am starting my JavaScript Fluency webpage tonight or tomorrow.

                    <p style="color: white;">I presented this week as did some on my class mates. I thought that "basic" JavaScript Objects were more complex than they are.
                    I was able to create objects set to variable and create classes from functions. I was able to assign them properties and prototype methods.
                I wish I knew more about standardization. It seems like there would be a set industry standard that is deemed "the best", but my team and I all
                found vaious ways of doing the same thing.</p>

                    <p style="color: white;">This week I spent a lot of time looking at AJAX. Because life happened I wasn't able to
                     write my code to pass it off this week. I bugeted my time so that if something happened I would not fall behind.
                    I just need to try and get ahead again. AJAX is great for retrieving data from files on the server. I would like 
                     to learn how to write to files as well. Our team met this week. Paul did a great job on JavaScript Objects.</p>

                    <p style="color: white;">I actually implemented AJAX this week but I've run into some snags with my HTML file.
                    I want to run a PHP script using AJAX so that it doesn't have to reload the page. That is the beauty of AJAX is 
                    that it runs in the background.I will use it to Post. I also need to go back over my JSON file and change it too.</p>

                    <p style="color: white;">This week I finished my AJAX site. I was also able to use local Storage to help me out.
                    I hope I will be able to pass them both off with one site since it was a lot more work than I thought. Local Storage
                    is very useful. It is like using session stored except it's bigger and doesn't expire. I like to use it the same way I 
                    use the singleton class in android development. It's handy to not pass all the variables around.</p>
